**Last updated:** 2026-08-20
**Last session model:** Opus 5 (Phase 5 planning). Implementation is Sonnet.

## Current phase

**Phase 4 is code-complete; one exit criterion is outstanding and is the
user's to do** (the real-phone clip — see "Open item"). **Phase 5 is
planned, not started** — `docs/PHASE5_PLAN.md`, D17–D22, ADR-011, ADR-012.
Waiting for a go-ahead to start P5.1.

## Done

- Phases 0–3: complete. `docs/PHASE2_PLAN.md` / `docs/PHASE3_PLAN.md` for
  what; ADR-001–008 for why.
- Phase 4, all three sub-phases (`docs/PHASE4_PLAN.md`, D13–D16, ADR-009,
  ADR-010): server contract + client data layer, the five real screens,
  then PWA + the toy model's removal.
- The Phase 1 toy model is **gone** — migration `0006` drops `toy`/
  `toy_event`. ADR-005's D7 exception ended exactly here, as planned.
- Phase 5 planning: D17–D22 decided with the user, ADR-011 (LISTEN/NOTIFY)
  and ADR-012 (SSE query-token auth) written. P5.1/P5.2 split approved.

## Not done / in progress

- P5.1: not started, needs the user's go-ahead (handoff R1). A ready-to-use
  starting prompt is in `temp.txt` (gitignored scratch file).
- **The real-phone airplane-mode recording is not done.** User has said
  keep it — do not drop it, do not re-propose dropping it.
- No known open bugs.

## Exit criteria status

Phase 4: every criterion in `docs/PHASE4_PLAN.md` met and checked against
real commands, **except** the real-phone recording. Two needed judgement:

- `grep -rn toy_ client/src` returns **2 matches, both required** —
  `version(1)`'s shipped declaration (never edit shipped schema history)
  and `version(4)`'s `toy_cache: null`, which *is* Dexie's drop syntax.
  `server/app` is clean. Observation 30.
- `offline-sync.spec.ts` runs against the **built** app on `:4173`, not the
  dev server — `injectManifest` only produces a real precache in a
  production build. Observation 33.

## Open item for the user

**The real-phone clip** (plan §8.5, the Review-III fallback) is still
owed, and is being kept. Needs a physical Android phone: open the app, add
to home screen, airplane mode, create a referral, restore signal, record it
syncing. Ten minutes; nothing in this repo can do it. Note where the file
lands here once recorded — it is deliberately not committed (large binary).

## Next concrete step

**Start P5.1** on the user's go-ahead, in a new session, using the prompt
in `temp.txt`. P5.1 is SLA profiles + the escalation sweep + escalation
lifecycle: server only, no SSE, no dashboard, **no migration** (`alembic
heads` stays `0006`). Model: Sonnet.

## Verify the current state yourself

Client. **Both** servers must be up: `:5173` (dev, four specs) and `:4173`
(the built app with its real PWA precache — `offline-sync.spec.ts` only).

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec client npx tsc --noEmit && docker compose exec client npm run build
docker compose exec -d client npm run preview        # starts :4173
cd client && npx playwright test                     # expect 5 passed
```

Server (`alembic heads` should print `0006`):

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS nirantharseva_test;" -c "CREATE DATABASE nirantharseva_test;"
docker compose run --rm -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:dev@db:5432/nirantharseva_test" \
  api sh -c "alembic upgrade head && python -m app.seed && ruff check . && ruff format --check . && pytest -q && python -m app.verify_replay"
```
Expect `187 passed`, clean.

To see the screens by hand: open `http://localhost:5173/login`, log in as
`asha_a`/`dev` (or `mo1`/`dev` for Screen 5). `/supervisor` and
`/identity-review` are reachable directly as placeholders.

## Settled decisions (do not re-ask)

- Name: NirantharSeva everywhere.
- Python: `uv`, lockfile committed. Node: `npm`, lockfile committed.
- Git hosting: GitHub, private repo, GitHub Actions CI.
- `make` is not installed — use the `docker compose` equivalents (Makefile
  documents the mapping).
- `react-router-dom`: yes. `dexie-react-hooks`: no. `vite-plugin-pwa`: yes.
- GitHub Actions minutes: not a concern.
- Screenshots: either way is fine (user's answer) — `docs/screenshots/`
  currently holds one per screen plus the PWA offline-reload proof.
- Review-I is a literature review/survey, not a live demo — no rehearsal
  needed.
- The real-phone offline clip stays on the list. Do not propose dropping
  it again.
- All decisions D1–D22: settled — see the relevant `PHASE*_PLAN.md` / ADR.
  Phase 5's four (SSE query-token auth, LISTEN/NOTIFY, `SLA_SCALE`,
  P5.1/P5.2 split) were answered 2026-08-20; do not re-ask them.

## Known problems and workarounds

- Host Python is 3.14.7; project pins 3.12 via `uv` — never build against
  host Python.
- `uv` full path if a fresh shell can't find it:
  `C:\Users\pavan\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Links\uv.exe`.
- Docker Desktop lives at
  `C:\Users\pavan\AppData\Local\Programs\DockerDesktop\Docker Desktop.exe`
  (not Program Files) — start it and wait ~1 minute if compose can't reach
  the daemon.
- Named volumes (`server_venv`, `client_node_modules`) need `-V` to refresh
  after a dependency change: `docker compose up -d --build -V <service>`.
- A long-running `vite dev` inside Docker doesn't always pick up file
  changes through the Windows bind mount. `docker compose restart client`
  fixes it — try this before debugging a test failure that looks like an
  app bug. **Hit twice in P4.3**; it costs a confusing red run every time.
- `docker compose restart client` also **kills the `:4173` preview
  server** (it isn't the container's main command). Restart it by hand
  afterwards or `offline-sync.spec.ts` fails for the wrong reason:
  `docker compose exec -d client npm run preview`.
- `test_concurrent_pushes_leave_no_gap_in_the_pull_cursor` used to fail
  intermittently on this machine while green in CI (observation 22). P4.3
  ported it off the toy model onto referral ops and it has passed on every
  run since — watch it, but it is no longer a known failure.
- A persistent test-database volume across many manual `pytest` runs can
  eventually break `/sync/pull?limit=1000`-based tests. Reset with the
  `DROP DATABASE`/`CREATE DATABASE` commands above before trusting a red
  run that touches pull.
- Grep-based exit criteria match your explanatory comments, your own
  identifiers, and your framework's required syntax — not just the code
  you meant to find. Read every match; never treat the hit count as
  pass/fail (observations 13, 29, 30).
- **The rest of the hard-won detail lives in `docs/PHASE2_OBSERVATIONS.md`**
  — read it before touching `server/` or `client/src/sync/`. Append-only,
  one section per phase, never rewritten.
